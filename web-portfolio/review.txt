Classmate Portfolio Review-Micah Schweinsberg

1. Most Impressive Feature:
The standout feature of this portfolio is the animated navigation bar that smoothly transitions between sections. It adds a polished, professional feel and enhances user experience by making site navigation intuitive and visually engaging.

2. Constructive Suggestion:
While the overall design is strong, the contact form could benefit from clearer input validation. For example, adding inline error messages when fields are left blank or improperly formatted would improve usability and accessibility. Great work overall!
